# Named Entities Recognition (NER)
This project demonstrates how to perform Named Entities Recognition (NER) using Python. The project uses the spacy library for training the NER model and matplotlib for visualizing the results.

## Requirements
Python 3.x
pandas
spacy
matplotlib
Data
The dataset used in this project is a collection of articles in csv format, you can use your own dataset and adjust the code to fit your data.

## Installation
Install the required libraries by running pip install -r requirements.txt
Download the pre-trained model for your language, for example python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
Usage
Run the named_entities_recognition.py script to train the NER model on the dataset.
The script will output the entities and their labels in the dataset.
You can adjust the model and the parameters as you prefer.
Results
The results of the NER model will be the entities and their labels, these entities can indicate the important information in the articles.

It's important to note that spacy is a library specialized in NLP tasks like Named Entities Recognition, dependency parsing, POS tagging, and text classification. The pre-trained models for many languages are available on the website and you can fine
